## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
# We will use sklearn to create training and testing data
# and for normalization of the data set
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```
